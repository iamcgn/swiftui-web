// Associated objects without the Objective-C runtime: `objc_setAssociatedObject` and
// `objc_getAssociatedObject`, which Apple's Foundation brings with the runtime, for the stock
// wasm SDK. Kingfisher keeps its per-view download state this way (Runtime.swift), in EhPanda,
// IceCubes and the other apps that use it. With the Objective-C runtime SDK the runtime's own
// functions are in scope instead (WebFoundation re-exports `ObjectiveC`, decision 0023).
//
// A value is kept for its object while the object lives: each object's values sit in a table
// with a weak reference to the object, and a table whose object has gone is dropped when its
// identifier comes round again or at the next sweep of the tables. A value type has no identity
// to hang values on (Apple boxes it afresh each time, so its values are never found again);
// here it gets no values either. A page runs one thread, so the tables take no lock.
