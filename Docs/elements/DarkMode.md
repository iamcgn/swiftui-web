# Dark appearance: colorScheme, preferredColorScheme, system colours and control inks

Apple docs: [ColorScheme](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/colorscheme),
[colorScheme](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/environmentvalues/colorscheme),
[preferredColorScheme(_:)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/preferredcolorscheme(_:)).

## API surface

| API | Notes |
|---|---|
| `ColorScheme`, `EnvironmentValues.colorScheme`, `.environment(\.colorScheme, …)` | implemented: system colours, label colours, control inks, list and field backgrounds and asset variants follow the environment |
| `preferredColorScheme(_:)` | implemented: applies to the whole window (the root environment), `nil` returns to the system appearance; inside a sheet, popover or other presentation it applies to that presentation alone (its panel and content; `PresentationNode.preferredColorScheme`, 2026-10-11) |
| The system appearance | the browser host follows `prefers-color-scheme` (and its changes); the native host follows the window's effective appearance |
| `colorSchemeContrast`, `ColorSchemeContrast` | implemented 2026-10-11: `.increased` when the host reports it (`prefers-contrast: more` in the browser, `accessibilityDisplayShouldIncreaseContrast` natively, `Runtime.hostIncreasesContrast`); nothing built in changes its look for it (AppKit's focus and accent colours read the same under the high-contrast appearances) |

## Behaviour

`PlatformProfile.resolve(_:scheme:)` has a table per appearance (`ColorTable.swift`); `Color`
resolves through `environment.colorScheme`. Controls draw their fills, tracks, separators and
marks with `environment._ink(alpha)` (the `controlInk` system colour: black in light, white in
dark, at the same alphas, which is what Apple's inactive-window greys measure to); text fields,
lists, tables and date pickers fill with `controlBackground`; switch and slider knobs with `knob`;
presentations with `windowBackground`.

`Runtime.hostColorScheme` is the system appearance a host reports (seeded from the initial
environment, so fixtures and tests choose theirs); `preferredColorScheme` records the tree's
preference on the runtime; `applyColorScheme` (in `layout`) moves the root environment to the
effective scheme and re-applies the root view (`RootNode.reapply`), so every node resolves its
colours again. `Runtime.paintsWindowBackground` (hosts set it) makes `render` start with the
window background; goldens are transparent, so fixtures leave it off.

The harness gives a fixture with `.colorScheme(.dark)` a `darkAqua` window (AppKit-backed
controls follow the window, not the environment) and the fixture catalog's dark variants
(`FixtureAssets.appearance`).

## Verification (2026-09-04; `dark/chrome` 2026-10-11)

Tier A: 6 fixtures exact. Tier C: `dark/system-colors` and `dark/text` 0.00 %, `dark/list`
0.02 %, `dark/controls` 0.33 %, `dark/chrome` 0.63 %; Tier B within 0.7 %. `DarkModeTests` cover
the tables, the ink swap, field and text colours, `preferredColorScheme` on and off, a host
scheme change re-resolving a mounted tree, the painted window background, a sheet's own scheme
and the contrast value.

## Not yet covered

Sidebar backgrounds, popover and menu panels in dark, the clock face in dark (inks, unmeasured),
the gallery page chrome, a look for increased contrast.
