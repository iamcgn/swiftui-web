// AudioToolbox on the web: system sounds. A page has no system sound set and no vibration motor,
// so playing a system sound (an alert, a tick, the vibrate ID) is silent; a completion runs as
// soon as the sound would have finished. Apps call these for feedback beside what they show, so
// nothing an app draws depends on them.
